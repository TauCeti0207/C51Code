				Something About Return Value Of Master_readByte(addr) 
	if you defined a unsigned char variable to save the values from 
Master_readByte(addr).it's value equal to ASCII,the value printf to screen 
used "%c" is ASCII codes! But,with using "%d" unexpected value will occour!
	if your defined a int variable to save the values from Master_readByte(addr).
As we all know,a int needs 16 bits in Keil C51,the 8 bits of MSB are real value of 
Master_readByte(addr).	And the 8 bits of LSB are all zeros.So,when using printf() 
with "%c" unexpected value will occour! Using printf() with "%d" ,the value printed
is the real value multiply 256. 	Also we can use _iror_( ,8) function,then printf
with "%c".The value printed is a char's(ACII) corresponding decimalism(DEC)value.
Using printf() with "%d",print the real value.
